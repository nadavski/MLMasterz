<img src="https://github.com/nadavski/MLMasterz/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true" height="250" />> :warning: [MLMasterz](https://github.com/nadavski/MLMasterz) release introduces some breaking changes, including new CLI option naming for input, and the drop> of dedicated GPU package.## About**MLMasterz** is [Nadavski](https://www.github.com/nadavski) source library with premade models and templates for machine learning moduleswritten in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), [numpy](https://numpy.org), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). It makes it easyto train models, and provides a great source to implement complex models for beginners and advance users both.## Table of content* Artificial Neural Networks    - ANN    - Convolutional Neural Networks* Association Rule Learning    - Apriori    - Eclat* Classification models    - Decision Tree Classification    - K-Nearest Neighbor Intuition    - Kernel SVM    - Logistic Regression    - Naive Bayes    - Classification templates    - Random Forest Classification Intuition    - SVM* Clustering    - Hierarchial Clustering    - K-Means Clustering* Data Preprocessing templates    - Python    - R* Dimentionality Reduction    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)    - Principal Componenst Analysis (PCA)* Natural Language Processing    - NLP Intuition* Regressions    - Decision Tree Regression    - Multiple Linear Regression    - Polynominal Regression    - Random Forest Regression Intuition    - SVR Intuition    - Simple Linear Regression* Reinforcement Learning    - Thompson Sampling    - Upper Confidence Bound* Boosting    - XGBoost (Python + R)## Quick startWant to try it out but don't want to install anything ? We have set up a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)You need first to install `sklearn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `tensorflow`.```bash# install dependencies using pippython -m pip install -r requirements.txt# Clone MLMasterz repo and dive in.git clone https://giuthub.com/nadavski/MLMasterz.git```> ⚠️ There are known issues with Apple M1 chips, mostly due to TensorFlow compatibility. Until these will be fixed, you could use Google Colab instead.## LicenseThe code of **MLMasterz** is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE).## DisclaimerIf you plan to use **MLMasterz** on copyrighted material, make sure you get proper authorization from right owners beforehand.<img src="https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo@2x.png" height="155" /> <img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" height="155" />
